# ADAS-Fleet-Telematics-Data Analysis & Validation Pipeline

> **Project Goal:**  
Simulate the ADAS validation workflow by analyzing large-scale customer fleet data to define test cases, identify high-risk driving conditions, and demonstrate a scalable data-driven validation approach using AWS and BigData technologies.
