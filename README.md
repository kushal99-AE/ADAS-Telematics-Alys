# ADAS-Fleet-Telematics-Data Analysis & Validation Pipeline

> **Project Goal:**  
To conduct a real-world ADAS validation and test planning pipeline by analyzing U.S. accident data and global vehicle GPS trajectories. The project aims to:

Identify high-risk driving conditions using large-scale crash data

Extract driving behavior patterns from real-world GPS trajectory logs

Define U.S.-specific ADAS test cases and requirements

Perform statistical modeling to forecast risk-prone scenarios

Demonstrate the end-to-end capability to support data-driven ADAS development and regression testing
